Alzheimer disease (AD) is a most common form of dementia and eventually causes
impairments of learning ability and memory function. In the present study, we
investigated the effects of treadmill exercise on the symptoms of AD focusing on 
the microglial activation-induced apoptosis. AD was made by bilateral
intracerebroventricular injection of streptozotocin. The rats in the exercise
groups were made to run on a treadmill once a day for 30 min during 4 weeks. The 
distance and latency in the Morris water maze task and the latency in the
step-down avoidance task were increased in the AD rats, in contrast, treadmill
exercise shortened these parameters. The numbers of terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling-positive and caspase-3-positive cells
in the hippocampal dentate gyrus were decreased in the AD rats, in contrast,
treadmill exercise suppressed these numbers. Expressions of glial fibrillary
acidic protein (GFAP) and cluster of differentiation molecule 11B (CD11b) in the 
hippocampal dentate gyrus were increased in the AD rats, in contrast, treadmill
exercise suppressed GFAP and CD11b expressions. Bax expression was increased and 
Bcl-2 expression was decreased in the hippocampus of AD rats, in contrast,
treadmill exercise decreased Bax expression and increased Bcl-2 expression. The
present results demonstrated that treadmill exercise ameliorated AD-induced
impairments of spatial learning ability and short-term memory through suppressing
apoptosis. The antiapoptotic effect of treadmill exercise might be ascribed to
the inhibitory effect of treadmill exercise on microglial activation.

OBJECTIVE: To address the association between exercise capacity and the onset of 
dementia, Alzheimer disease, and cognitive impairment.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: For 6104 consecutive veteran patients (mean ± SD age:
59.2±11.4 years) referred for treadmill exercise testing, the combined end point 
of dementia, Alzheimer disease, and cognitive impairment was abstracted from the 
Veterans Affairs computerized patient record system.
RESULTS: After mean ± SD follow-up of 10.3±5.5 years, 353 patients (5.8%)
developed the composite end point at a mean ± SD age of 76.7±10.3 years. After
correction for confounders in multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression,
higher age at exercise testing (hazard ratio [HR]=1.08; 95% CI, 1.07-1.09;
P<.001), current smoking (HR=1.44; 95% CI, 1.08-1.93; P=.01), and exercise
capacity (HR=0.92; 95% CI, 0.89-0.96; P<.001) emerged as predictors of cognitive 
impairment. Each 1-metabolic equivalent increase in exercise capacity conferred a
nearly 8% reduction in the incidence of cognitive impairment. Meeting the
recommendations for daily activity was not associated with a delay in onset of
cognitive impairment (HR=1.07; 95% CI, 0.86-1.32; P=.55).
CONCLUSION: Exercise capacity is strongly associated with cognitive function; the
inverse association between fitness and cognitive impairment provides an
additional impetus for health care providers to promote physical activity.

BACKGROUND: Physical exercise may have some effect on cognition in patients with 
Alzheimer disease (AD). However, the underlying biochemical effects are unclear. 
Animal studies have shown that amyloid beta (Aβ), one of the pathological
hallmarks of AD, can be altered with high levels of physical activity.
AIM: The objective of this study was to elucidate the effect of 16 weeks of
moderate- to high-intensity physical exercise on the biomarkers of AD, with
special emphasis on the amyloidogenic pathway.
METHODS: From a total of 53 patients with AD participating in the Preserving
Cognition, Quality of Life, Physical Health and Functional Ability in Alzheimer's
Disease: The Effect of Physical Exercise (ADEX) study we analyzed cerebrospinal
fluid samples for Aβ species, total tau (t-tau), phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and
soluble amyloid precursor protein (sAPP) species. We also assessed the patients
for apolipoprotein E ε4 (ApoE ε4) genotype.
RESULTS: We found no effect of 16 weeks of physical exercise on the selected
biomarkers, and no effect of ApoE ε4 genotype.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the possible effect of physical exercise on
cognition in patients with AD is not due to modulation of Aβ, t-tau, p-tau and
sAPP species.

Diabetes mellitus is considered as a risk factor for Alzheimer disease. The aim
of the present study was to evaluate the possibility whether treadmill exercise
ameliorates Alzheimer disease-associated memory loss in the diabetes mellitus.
For this study, the effects of treadmill exercise on short-term memory and
spatial learning ability in relation with Wnt signaling pathway were evaluated
using the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced by
intraperitoneal injection of STZ. Step-down avoidance task and 8-arm radial maze 
test were performed for the memory function. Immunohistochemistry for
5-bro-mo-2'-deoxyridine (BrdU) and doublecortin (DCX) and Western blot for Wnt3
and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) were conducted. The rats in the exercise
groups were made to run on the treadmill for 30 min per one day, 5 times a week, 
during 12 weeks. In the present results, short-term memory and spatial learning
ability were deteriorated by induction of diabetes. Treadmill exercise improved
short-term memory and spatial learning ability in the diabetic rats. The numbers 
of BrdU-positive and DCX-positive cells in the hippocampal dentate gyrus were
decreased by induction of diabetes. Treadmill exercise increased these numbers in
the diabetic rats. Wnt3 expression in the hippocampus was decreased and GSK-3β
expression in the hippocampus was increased by induction of diabetes. Treadmill
exercise increased Wnt3 expression and suppressed GSK-3β expression in the
diabetic rats. The present study suggests that treadmill exercise alleviates
Alzheimer disease-associated memory loss by increasing neurogenesis through
activating Wnt signaling pathway in the diabetic rats.

OBJECTIVES: To examine whether a regular, long-term exercise program performed by
individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) at home or as group-based exercise at
an adult daycare center has beneficial effects on cognition; to examine secondary
outcomes of a trial that has been published earlier.
DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial.
SETTING: Community.
PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling dyads (N = 210) of individuals with AD and their
spousal caregivers randomized into three groups.
INTERVENTION: Two types of intervention comprising customized home-based exercise
(HE) and group-based exercise (GE), each twice a week for 1 year, were compared
with a control group (CG) receiving usual community care.
MEASUREMENTS: Cognitive function was measured using the Clock Drawing Test (CDT),
Verbal Fluency (VF), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), and Mini-Mental State
Examination (MMSE) at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months of follow-up.
RESULTS: Executive function, measured using CDT, improved in the HE group, and
changes in the score were significantly better than those of the CG at 12 months 
(adjusted for age, sex, and CDR, P = .03). All groups deteriorated in VF and MMSE
score during the intervention, and no significant differences between the groups 
were detected at 12-month follow-up when analyses were adjusted for age, sex, and
CDR.
CONCLUSION: Regular, long-term, customized HE improved the executive function of 
community-dwelling older people with memory disorders, but the effects were mild 
and were not observed in other domains of cognition.

OBJECTIVE: Demographic changes are increasing the pressure to improve therapeutic
strategies against cognitive decline in Alzheimer disease (AD) and mild cognitive
impairment (MCI). Besides drug treatment, physical activity seems to be a
promising intervention target as epidemiological and clinical studies suggest
beneficial effects of exercise training on cognition. Using comparable inclusion 
and exclusion criteria, we analyzed the efficacy of drug therapy (cholinesterase 
inhibitors, memantine, and Ginkgo biloba) and exercise interventions for
improving cognition in AD and MCI populations.
METHODS: We searched The Cochrane Library, EBSCO, OVID, Web of Science, and U.S
Food and Drug Administration data from inception through October 30, 2013.
Randomized controlled trials in which at least one treatment arm consisted of an 
exercise or a pharmacological intervention for AD or MCI patients, and which had 
either a non-exposed control condition or a control condition that received
another intervention. Treatment discontinuation rates and Standardized Mean
Change score using Raw score standardization (SMCR) of cognitive performance were
calculated.
RESULTS: Discontinuation rates varied substantially and ranged between 0% and 49%
with a median of 18%. Significantly increased discontinuation rates were found
for galantamine and rivastigmine as compared to placebo in AD studies. Drug
treatments resulted in a small pooled effect on cognition (SMCR: 0.23, 95% CI:
0.20 to 0.25) in AD studies (N = 45, 18,434 patients) and no effect in any of the
MCI studies (N = 5, 3,693 patients; SMCR: 0.03, 95% CI: 0.00 to 0.005). Exercise 
interventions had a moderate to strong pooled effect size (SMCR: 0.83, 95% CI:
0.59 to 1.07) in AD studies (N = 4, 119 patients), and a small effect size (SMCR:
0.20, 95% CI: 0.11 to 0.28) in MCI (N = 6, 443 patients).
CONCLUSIONS: Drug treatments have a small but significant impact on cognitive
functioning in AD and exercise has the potential to improve cognition in AD and
MCI. Head-to-head trials with sufficient statistical power are necessary to
directly compare efficacy, safety, and acceptability. Combining these two
approaches might further increase the efficacy of each individual intervention.

Alzheimer's disease is one of the most devastating neurodegenerative disorders,
and this disease is characterized by severe memory impairment and decline of
cognition. Hippocampal neurons are vulnerable to injury induced by Alzheimer's
disease. Physical exercise is known to promote cell survival and functional
recovery after brain injuries. In the present study, we investigated the effects 
of treadmill exercise on short-term memory in relation with neurogenesis in the
rats with amyloid β25-35 (Aβ25-35)-induced Alzheimer's disease. The rat model of 
Alzheimer's disease was induced by the intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of
Aβ25-35, using a stereotaxic instrument. The rats in the exercise group were
forced to run on a treadmill for 30 min once daily for 4 consecutive weeks,
starting 2 days after Aβ25-35 injection. Presently, short-term memory was
deteriorated and apical dendritic length in the hippocampus was shortened in the 
hippocampus by Aβ25-35 injection. In contrast, treadmill exercise alleviated
memory impairment and increased apical dendritic length in the Aβ25-35-injected
rats. Neurogenesis and brain-derived neurotorphic factor (BDNF) and tyrosine
kinase B (trkB) in the hippocampal dentate gyrus were decreased by Aβ25-35
injection. Treadmill exercise increased neurogenesis and expressions of BDNF and 
trkB expressions. The present study shows that treadmill exercise may provide
therapeutic value for the alleviating symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.

Alzheimer disease (AD) and cerebrovascular disease often coexist with advanced
age. Mounting evidence indicates that the presence of vascular disease and its
risk factors increase the risk of AD, suggesting a potential overlap of the
underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. In particular, atherosclerosis,
endothelial dysfunction, and stiffening of central elastic arteries have been
shown to associate with AD. Currently, there are no effective treatments for the 
cure and prevention of AD. Vascular risk factors are modifiable via either
pharmacological or lifestyle intervention. In this regard, habitual aerobic
exercise is increasingly recognized for its benefits on brain structure and
cognitive function. Considering the well-established benefits of regular aerobic 
exercise on vascular health, exercise-related improvements in brain structure and
cognitive function may be mediated by vascular adaptations. In this review, we
will present the current evidence for the physiological mechanisms by which
vascular health alters the structural and functional integrity of the aging brain
and how improvements in vascular health, via regular aerobic exercise,
potentially benefits cognitive function.

IMPORTANCE: Few rigorous clinical trials have investigated the effectiveness of
exercise on the physical functioning of patients with Alzheimer disease (AD).
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of intense and long-term exercise on the
physical functioning and mobility of home-dwelling patients with AD and to
explore its effects on the use and costs of health and social services.
DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 210 home-dwelling patients with AD living
with their spousal caregiver.
INTERVENTIONS: The 3 trial arms included (1) group-based exercise (GE; 4-hour
sessions with approximately 1-hour training) and (2) tailored home-based exercise
(HE; 1-hour training), both twice a week for 1 year, and (3) a control group (CG)
receiving the usual community care.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Functional Independence Measure (FIM), the Short
Physical Performance Battery, and information on the use and costs of social and 
health care services.
RESULTS: All groups deteriorated in functioning during the year after
randomization, but deterioration was significantly faster in the CG than in the
HE or GE group at 6 (P = .003) and 12 (P = .015) months. The FIM changes at 12
months were -7.1 (95% CI, -3.7 to -10.5), -10.3 (95% CI, -6.7 to -13.9), and
-14.4 (95% CI, -10.9 to -18.0) in the HE group, GE group, and CG, respectively.
The HE and GE groups had significantly fewer falls than the CG during the
follow-up year. The total costs of health and social services for the HE
patient-caregiver dyads (in US dollars per dyad per year) were $25,112 (95% CI,
$17,642 to $32,581) (P = .13 for comparison with the CG), $22,066 in the GE group
($15,931 to $28,199; P = .03 vs CG), and $34,121 ($24,559 to $43,681) in the CG.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: An intensive and long-term exercise program had
beneficial effects on the physical functioning of patients with AD without
increasing the total costs of health and social services or causing any
significant adverse effects.

INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to determine the reliability of
treadmill peak exercise testing in people with very mild-to-mild Alzheimer
disease (AD).
METHODS: Sixteen subjects with very mild-to-mild AD performed graded peak
treadmill exercise tests twice within a 14-day period. Heart rate, oxygen
consumption, and respiratory exchange ratio (RER) were continuously monitored.
Peak values were analyzed for absolute level of agreement.
RESULTS: Fourteen participants (87.5%) completed testing. Reliability was
excellent with total peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) (ml/kg/min) highly
correlated across the two tests (r = 0.94, p < .001) with an intraclass
correlation coefficient (ICC[3,1]) of 0.92 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.78, 
0.97). The standard error of measurement (SEM) for VO2peak was 1.29 (95% CI =
0.88, 1.89).
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that peak exercise testing on a treadmill is 
reliable in the early stages of AD.

CONTEXT: Exercise training for patients with Alzheimer disease combined with
teaching caregivers how to manage behavioral problems may help decrease the
frailty and behavioral impairment that are often prevalent in patients with
Alzheimer disease.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a home-based exercise program combined with
caregiver training in behavioral management techniques would reduce functional
dependence and delay institutionalization among patients with Alzheimer disease.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Randomized controlled trial of 153
community-dwelling patients meeting National Institute of Neurological and
Communicative Diseases and Stroke/Alzheimer Disease and Related Disorders
Association criteria for Alzheimer disease, conducted between June 1994 and April
1999.
INTERVENTIONS: Patient-caregiver dyads were randomly assigned to the combined
exercise and caregiver training program, Reducing Disability in Alzheimer Disease
(RDAD), or to routine medical care (RMC). The RDAD program was conducted in the
patients' home over 3 months.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Physical health and function (36-item Short-Form Health
Survey's [SF-36] physical functioning and physical role functioning subscales and
Sickness Impact Profile's Mobility subscale), and affective status (Hamilton
Depression Rating Scale and Cornell Depression Scale for Depression in Dementia).
RESULTS: At 3 months, in comparison with the routine care patients, more patients
in the RDAD group exercised at least 60 min/wk (odds ratio [OR], 2.82; 95%
confidence interval [CI], 1.25-6.39; P =.01) and had fewer days of restricted
activity (OR, 3.10; 95% CI, 1.08-8.95; P<.001). Patients in the RDAD group also
had improved scores for physical role functioning compared with worse scores for 
patients in the RMC group (mean difference, 19.29; 95% CI, 8.75-29.83; P<.001).
Patients in the RDAD group had improved Cornell Depression Scale for Depression
in Dementia scores while the patients in the RMC group had worse scores (mean
difference, -1.03; 95% CI, -0.17 to -1.91; P =.02). At 2 years, the RDAD patients
continued to have better physical role functioning scores than the RMC patients
(mean difference, 10.89; 95% CI, 3.62-18.16; P =.003) and showed a trend (19% vs 
50%) for less institutionalization due to behavioral disturbance. For patients
with higher depression scores at baseline, those in the RDAD group improved
significantly more at 3 months on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (mean
difference, 2.21; 95% CI, 0.22-4.20; P =.04) and maintained that improvement at
24 months (mean difference, 2.14; 95% CI, 0.14-4.17; P =.04).
CONCLUSION: Exercise training combined with teaching caregivers behavioral
management techniques improved physical health and depression in patients with
Alzheimer disease.

Increasing evidence indicates that mitochondrial dysfunction occurs in the
central nervous system as well as in the peripheral tissues from Alzheimer's
disease (AD) patients. We have recently shown that mitochondrial cytochrome c
oxidase (COX) activity is significantly reduced in brain and platelets from AD
patients compared to controls. In the present study we investigated whether
impaired COX activity could have functional consequences on energy metabolism.
Blood lactate concentration was monitored at rest and during incremental exercise
in 22 AD patients in whom COX activity in platelets was decreased compared to
controls (35.7 +/- 11.4 vs 48.4 +/- 1.4 nmol/min/mg, P < 0.01). In both resting
and exercising conditions, blood lactate was significantly higher in AD patients 
than in controls. Although the magnitude of exercise-related lactate accumulation
was not different between the two groups, an anticipated anaerobic lactate
threshold during the incremental forearm exercise was found in AD patients (50%
of maximal voluntary contraction MVC compared to 60% in controls). COX activity
was inversely related to lactate at a significant level for resting condition (r 
= -0.65) and borderline for anaerobic threshold exercise level. These results
support the hypothesis of a systemic impairment of the mitochondrial function in 
AD and indicate that decreased COX activity could have functional consequences on
metabolism.

BACKGROUND: Physical activity delays loss of autonomy in the elderly. In patients
with Alzheimer disease (AD), physical activity could be a useful strategy in
therapeutic management by delaying loss of functional independence and the usual 
complications of the disease.
OBJECTIVE: To determine, using standardized tools, the effects on autonomy (ADL, 
IADL), cognitive function (MMS), nutritional status (MNA), behavioral problems
(NPI) and risk of falls (Tinetti test) of a physical exercise program in patients
with AD.
DESIGN: Twenty-three subjects (13 men and 10 women, aged 71-92 years, mean 78
years) with AD (mean MMS 16, range 1-23) carried out for a mean of 7 weeks (5-12 
weeks) a program of endurance exercise (walking, exercise bicycle) adapted to
their individual capacities. Standardized gerontological evaluation was performed
before and after the study.
RESULTS: No significant change in autonomy (ADL, IADL) was observed. There was an
improvement in the MNA (p<0.001) and the MMS (p<0.001). Risk of falls (p<0.01)
and behavioral problems (p<0.05) decreased. These results were obtained without
increasing family workload.
CONCLUSION: We suggest that physical activity is a therapeutic option which can
reduce nutritional and behavioral complications and risk of falls in subjects
with AD.
